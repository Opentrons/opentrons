## Opentrons App Changes in 7.0.2

Welcome to the v7.0.2 release of the Opentrons App!

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where robot system updates over USB were stalling
- Fixes an issue where app protocol analysis would fail if you had Python 3.10 installed on your computer and installed the opentrons package there

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 7.0.1

Welcome to the v7.0.1 release of the Opentrons App! This release builds on the major release that added support for Opentrons Flex.

### Improved Features

- Pipettes move higher during Labware Position Check to avoid crashes in all deck slots, not just those with labware loaded in the protocol.

### Bug Fixes

- The app no longer blocks running valid protocols due to "not valid JSON" or "apiLevel not declared" errors.
- Robot commands, like turning the lights on or off, no longer take a long time to execute.

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 7.0.0

Welcome to the v7.0.0 release of the Opentrons App! This release adds support for the Opentrons Flex robot, instruments, modules, and labware.

### New Features

Opentrons Flex features

- Connect to Opentrons Flex robots via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or USB.
- Send a protocol to Opentrons Flex. Protocols are stored on the Flex robot and can be run from the touchscreen.
- Run protocols that automatically move labware with the Flex Gripper, including onto and off of the new Magnetic Block.
- Attach, detach, and run automated calibration for Flex pipettes and the Flex Gripper.

General app features

- Manually move labware around the deck during protocols. The app shows animated instructions for which labware to move, and lets you resume the protocol when movement is complete.
- See when your protocol will pause. During a run, marks on the protocol timeline show all pauses that require user attention, including labware movement.

### Improved Features

- The app loads various pages faster.

## Opentrons App Changes in 6.0.1

Welcome to the v6.0.1 release of the Opentrons App! This release focuses on a visual redesign of the app that offers more ways to manage protocols even when you're not connected to a robot.

This release also includes updates to the robot operating system, so be sure to update any OT-2s before running protocols with this version of the app.

### New Features

Updated design: A more polished and modern design, built around the new, always-accessible Protocols, Labware, and Devices sections.

Protocols section

- Import multiple protocols and manage them all in one place.
- In-app protocol analysis lets you import Python and JSON protocol files without connecting to a robot.
- View deck setup, required hardware, and protocol metadata — before, during, or after a run.

Labware section

- Browse labware definitions from the Opentrons Labware Library right in the app.
- Import custom labware and manage it alongside standard labware.

Devices section

- New view for currently available and recently connected robots.
- See recently run protocols on a robot, including those run from other computers.
- Run a protocol directly from the robot details page.
- Easily change a robot's name from the new robot settings page.

### 6.0.0 to 6.0.1

The 6.0.1 hotfix release fixes two issues:

- The app's "Override Path to Python" advanced setting now works properly on Windows
- It's once again possible to save changes made to pipette settings

### Improved Features

Labware Position Check

- When re-running a protocol, the app will now automatically recommend stored Labware Offset data (from the last 20 runs on that robot) that applies to the same labware and deck slot.
- When running Labware Position Check, you will see live offset values as you jog the pipette.

## Opentrons App Changes in 5.0.2

Welcome to the v5.0.2 release of the Opentrons App!

The 5.0.2 release reshapes the way you upload and set up protocols to run on your OT-2. Read below to find out about the new features in 5.0.0.

### New Features

- A completely revamped protocol upload experience that will walk you through setting up your OT-2 for the run
- A new way to check the positioning of your labware prior to a run, where you can apply offsets to each labware individually
- More visibility into the progress of protocol execution on the robot
- Quick and easy re-running of your last used protocol

### 5.0.1 to 5.0.2

The 5.0.2 hotfix release fixes three issues:

1. If you use `load_labware_from_definition` in your Python protocol, you are now able to use Labware Position Check.
2. User-defined labware labels, if present, are now displayed in "Labware Setup"
3. Certain types of protocol upload failures will now show an error message instead of silently failing.

### 5.0.0 to 5.0.1

The 5.0.1 hotfix release contains a small fix to the Labware Position Check to appropriately handle protocols that load pipettes, but never pick up tips with that pipette.

### Known Issues

- Your last run protocol will not be saved through robot reboots
- When you load multiple instances of the same module type in a protocol, the USB port numbers shown in "Module Setup" are incorrect.

- Protocol upload should be much faster

---

## Opentrons App Changes in 4.0.0

Opentrons App 4.0.0 is a major software release, bringing an entirely overhauled robot calibration process for the OT-2; a full switch to Opentrons Protocol API Version 2; and many look and feel improvements.

**After you install this update, you must calibrate your OT-2's pipette offsets and tip lengths before running a protocol**. This will take approximately fifteen minutes, but you will not be able to run a protocol until your OT-2 is calibrated.

### OT-2 Calibration Changes

In Opentrons App and Robot Software 4.0.0, the calibration process for the OT-2 is different and improved from major version 3. With these changes, you'll calibrate less often; the calibration processes are shorter, easier, and more reliable; and you can finally use different kinds of tips on the same pipette in the same protocol accurately.

For more in-depth information on the changes, [click here](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3499692-how-calibration-works-on-the-ot-2).

### Full Use of Python Protocol API Version 2

We released Python Protocol API Version 2 almost a year ago, and have been continuously improving it since, with 8 new intermediate API levels, each containing bugfixes, improvements, or support for new hardware. It's ready to be the only way Python protocols are written for the OT-2. Accordingly, in 4.0.0 and subsequent releases, **the OT-2 will not accept Python Protocol API Version 1 protocols**.

### Look and Feel Changes

In 4.0.0, the Opentrons App has some major changes to the Robots tab and the Pipettes & Modules page. These changes present information about the new calibration data more concisely in a better-organized way. We hope you like it!
