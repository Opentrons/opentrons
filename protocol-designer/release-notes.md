## Opentrons Protocol Designer Changes in 8.5

**Welcome to Protocol Designer v8.5!**

This release adds support for liquid classes in Protocol Designer protocols for the Flex, and includes feature improvements and bug fixes.

Use Opentrons-verified liquid classes to automatically define transfer settings and optimize liquid handling behavior based on liquid properties like viscosity. When adding liquids to your protocol, select an Opentrons-verified liquid class from the dropdown menu. You can choose whether or not to apply liquid class settings to protocol steps that use compatible Opentrons labware and pipettes.

### New Features

- Make edits to advanced settings like submerge and retract position and speed, touch tip, and air gap to customize each transfer.
- Customize push out volume after a dispense to ensure all liquid leaves the pipette tip.
- Add conditioning volumes to transfer steps. After aspirating liquid, the pipette will aspirate a smaller conditioning volume for a more accurate first dispense.

### Improved Features

- Protocol Designer includes a warning when you clear a slot with labware, a module, or a fixture used in a protocol step.

### Bug Fixes

- Transfer step details show correct aspirate and dispense volumes when distributing liquid (a single aspirate and multiple dispenses).

Running a protocol created in Protocol Designer now requires Opentrons App version 8.4.0 or newer.

## Opentrons Protocol Designer Changes in 8.4.3

**Welcome to Protocol Designer 8.4.3!**

This release adds support for drag and drop labware in Protocol Designer, and includes feature improvements and bug fixes.

When editing your protocol starting deck, click and drag to move any individual piece of labware to a new slot.

### Improvements

- To avoid deck conflicts with fixtures like the trash bin, add only one of each module in protocol setup. Click **Edit protocol** and **Protocol starting deck** to add and edit multiple modules as needed.
- See your protocol starting deck edits more easily with module highlighting when moving labware or editing a module step.

### Bug Fixes

- Protocol Designer always redirects to the protocol overview when you import an existing protocol from the home or settings page.
- When tip racks, labware, or modules aren't assigned to a transfer or module step, improved error recovery in Protocol Designer avoids a crash or unknown error.
- Protocol Designer displays an error for transfer or Flex gripper move steps with off-deck labware, and when a transfer volume exceeds the well limit.
- Touch tip is no longer available during a dispense into the trash bin.

Running a protocol created in Protocol Designer now requires Opentrons App version 8.3.0 or newer.

## Opentrons Protocol Designer Changes in 8.4.2

**Welcome to Protocol Designer 8.4.2!**

This hotfix release addresses a bug during protocol analysis on the Opentrons App caused by an air gap after dispense.

---

## Opentrons Protocol Designer Changes in 8.4.1

Version 8.4.1 was not released due to internal branching issues.

---

## Opentrons Protocol Designer Changes in 8.4.0

**Welcome to Protocol Designer 8.4.0!**

This release adds support for the Absorbance Plate Reader Module and includes feature improvements and bug fixes.

### Bug Fixes

- Move steps added to a Flex protocol now use the gripper by default.
- Use matching X and Y offset values to aspirate and dispense during a Mix step.

All protocols created in Protocol Designer now require version 8.2.0 or higher of the Opentrons App to run.

### New Features

**Absorbance Plate Reader Module GEN1**

You can add an Absorbance Plate Reader Module GEN1 to deck slots A3-D3 on the Flex. You'll also need to use a gripper to safely move the lid on and off the module.

To use the Absorbance Plate Reader Module in your Protocol Designer protocol, add the following steps:

- an Absorbance Plate Reader step to close the lid using the gripper
- an Absorbance Plate Reader step to initialize the module without labware inside. Choose from a single or multiple wavelengths.
- an Absorbance Plate Reader step to open the lid using the gripper
- a Move step to place a plate in the module. Using the gripper is optional.
- an Absorbance Plate Reader step to read the plate using the same wavelength choices.

Data from the Absorbance Plate Reader Module is exported as a .CSV file and can be found on your Flex's detail page in the Opentrons Desktop App. Repeat the steps shown above to open the lid and remove the plate.
