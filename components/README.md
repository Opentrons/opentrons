### unit tests

Unit tests are run with the rest of the repositories unit tests from the top level of the project.

```shell
make test-js
```

Unit tests live in a `__tests__` directory in the same directory as the module under test. When writing unit tests for components, we've found the following tests to be the most useful:

- DOM tests
  - Make sure the component renders the correct node type
  - Make sure DOM attributes are mapped correctly
  - Make sure handlers fire correctly
- Render tests

  - Snapshot tests using [jest's snapshot functionality][jest-snapshots]
  - To regenerate snapshots after an intentional rendering change, run:

  ```shell
  make test-js updateSnapshot=true
  ```
