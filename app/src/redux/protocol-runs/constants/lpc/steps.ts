/**
 * A step is associated with a view or multiple views that are a part of the
 * core flow. They are driven by CTA and are not side effects of robot state.
 *
 * Advancing a step advances the step counter, going back a step lowers
 * the step counter. If advancing/going back to a different view does not alter the step counter,
 * then the view should either be associated with an existing step or should be independent of any step (ex, "robot in motion").
