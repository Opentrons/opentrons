It's an infrastructural requirement for this to be at least newer than 2.14. Before then,
the protocol API is backed by the legacy non-Protocol-engine backend, which is not prepared to
handle anything but OT-2s.

The additional bump to 2.15 is because that's what we tested on, and because it adds all the
Flex-specific features.
