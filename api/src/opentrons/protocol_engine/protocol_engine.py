    A ProtocolEngine instance holds the state of a protocol as it executes,
    and manages calls to a command executor that actually implements the logic
    of the commands themselves.

    Lifetime:
        Instances are single-use. Each instance is associated with a single protocol,
        or a a single chain of robot control such as Labware Position Check.

    Concurrency:
        Instances live in `asyncio` event loops. Each instance must be constructed inside an
        event loop, and then must be interacted with exclusively through that
        event loop's thread--even for regular non-`async` methods, like `.pause()`.
        (This is because there are background async tasks that monitor state changes using
        primitives that aren't thread-safe. See ChangeNotifier.)
