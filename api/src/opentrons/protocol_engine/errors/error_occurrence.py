            *Defined* errors have a strictly defined cause and effect, and we generally
            design them to be recoverable. For example, a `pickUpTip` command might
            return a `tipPhysicallyMissing` error, which is defined, and which you can
            recover from by doing a new `pickUpTip` in a different location.

            The `errorType` and `errorInfo` fields are useful for reacting to defined
            errors.

            *Undefined* errors are everything else. They could represent more obscure
            hardware failures that we aren't handling yet, or just bugs in our software.
            You can continue issuing commands to a run after it encounters an undefined
            error, but the robot may not behave well. For example, if a movement command
            fails with an undefined error, it could leave the robot in a messed-up
            state, and the next movement command could have bad path planning that
            collides the pipettes with stuff on the deck. We allow you to take this risk
            because it's sometimes better than safely stopping the run, which can
            waste time and reagents.
