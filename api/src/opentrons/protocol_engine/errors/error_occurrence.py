            *Defined* errors have a strictly defined cause and effect, and we generally

            return a `tipPhysicallyMissing` error, which is defined, and which you can
            recover from by doing a new `pickUpTip` in a different location.

            hardware failures that we aren't handling yet, or just bugs in our software.
            You can continue issuing commands to a run after it encounters an undefined
            error, but the robot may not behave well. For example, if a movement command
            fails with an undefined error, it could leave the robot in a messed-up
            state, and the next movement command could have bad path planning that
            collides the pipettes with stuff on the deck. We allow you to take this risk
