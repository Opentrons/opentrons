"""Custom protocol command.

A "custom" command contains arbitrary payload and result data.
It can be used by ProtocolEngine plugins to represent external
commands in state that a vanilla ProtocolEngine would not
know about.

This data model serves as a wrapper to ensure custom, arbitrary
data still adheres to the shapes that ProtocolEngine expects.
If you are implementing a custom command, you should probably
put your own disambiguation identifier in the payload.
