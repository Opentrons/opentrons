"""Convert deck slots into the preferred style for a robot.

The deck slots on an OT-2 are labeled like "1", "2", ..., and on an OT-3 they're labeled like
"D1," "D2", ....

When Protocol Engine takes a deck slot as input, we generally want it to accept either style
of label. This helps make protocols more portable across robot types.

But, Protocol Engine should then immediately convert it to the "correct" style for the robot that
it's controlling or simulating. This makes it simpler to consume the robot's HTTP API,
and it makes it easier for us to reason about Protocol Engine's internal state.

This module does that conversion, for any Protocol Engine input that contains a reference to a
deck slot.
