    Postprocess the capacitance data taken from a sweep to find the calibration slot.

    The sweep should have covered both edges, going off the deck into the slot,

    Capacitance is proportional to the area of the "plates" involved in the sensing. To
    a first approximation, these are the flat circular face of the bottom of the probe,
    and the deck. When the probe begins to cross the edge of the deck, the area of the
    second "plate" - the deck - ends abruptly, in a straight line transverse to motion.

    constant velocity) is maximized as the center of the probe passes the edge of the
