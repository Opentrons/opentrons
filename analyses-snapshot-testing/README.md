# Analyses Generation and Snapshot Testing

## Setup

1. Follow the instructions in [DEV_SETUP.md](../DEV_SETUP.md)
1. `cd analyses-snapshot-testing`
1. use pyenv to install python 3.12 and set it as the local python version for this directory
1. `make setup`
1. Have docker installed and ready

## Concepts

- If working locally the branch you have checked out is the test code/snapshots you are working with.
  - In CI this is the `SNAPSHOT_REF`. This is the branch or tag of the test code/snapshots that analyses generated will be compared to.
- The `ANALYSIS_REF` is the branch or tag that you want analyses generated from.

## Build the opentrons-analysis image

> This ALWAYS gets the remote code pushed to Opentrons/opentrons for the specified ANALYSIS_REF

`make build-opentrons-analysis ANALYSIS_REF=chore_release-8.0.0`

## Running the tests locally

- Compare the current branch snapshots to analyses generated from the edge branch
  - `make build-opentrons-analysis ANALYSIS_REF=edge` this builds a docker image named and tagged `opentrons-analysis:edge`
    - this pulls the latest edge every time it builds!
  - `make snapshot-test ANALYSIS_REF=edge`
    - This runs the test. The test:
      - Spins up a container from the `opentrons-analysis:edge` image. ANALYSIS_REF=edge specifies the image to use.
      - Analyses as .json files are generated for all protocols defined in [protocols.py](./automation/data/protocols.py) and [protocols_with_overrides.py](./automation/data/protocols_with_overrides.py)
      - the test compares the generated analyses to the snapshots in the [./tests/**snapshots**/](./tests/__snapshots__/) directory

## Updating the snapshots

- Assuming you have already built the `opentrons-analysis:edge` image
- `make snapshot-test-update ANALYSIS_REF=edge`
  - This will update the snapshots in the [./tests/**snapshots**/](./tests/__snapshots__/) directory with the analyses generated from the edge branch

## Running the tests against specific protocols

> We are omitting ANALYSIS_REF=edge because we can, it is the default in the Makefile

- `make snapshot-test PROTOCOL_NAMES=Flex_S_v2_19_Illumina_DNA_PCR_Free OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL_NAMES=none`
- `make snapshot-test PROTOCOL_NAMES=none OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL_NAMES=Flex_X_v2_18_NO_PIPETTES_Overrides_BadTypesInRTP`
- `make snapshot-test PROTOCOL_NAMES="Flex_S_v2_19_Illumina_DNA_PCR_Free,OT2_S_v2_18_P300M_P20S_HS_TC_TM_SmokeTestV3" OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL_NAMES=none`

## Running a Flex just like `make -C robot-server dev-flex`

> This ALWAYS gets the remote code pushed to Opentrons/opentrons for the specified OPENTRONS_VERSION

```shell
cd analyses-snapshot-testing \
&& make build-rs OPENTRONS_VERSION=chore_release-8.0.0 \
&& make run-rs OPENTRONS_VERSION=chore_release-8.0.0`
```

### Default OPENTRONS_VERSION=edge in the Makefile so you can omit it if you want latest edge

`cd analyses-snapshot-testing && make build-rs && make run-rs`

## Running the Analyses Battery against your local code

1. `make build-local`
1. `make local-snapshot-test`

You have the option to specify one or many protocols to run the analyses on. This is also described above [Running the tests against specific protocols](#running-the-tests-against-specific-protocols)

- `make local-snapshot-test PROTOCOL_NAMES=Flex_S_v2_19_Illumina_DNA_PCR_Free OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL_NAMES=none`
