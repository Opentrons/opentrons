Title: "Python API: Vacuum Module"
description: How to use the Vacuum Module in a Python protocol.
---

The Vacuum Module is an automated filtration system for the Opentrons Flex liquid handling robot. This module enables Flex to run vacuum-based protocols for protein and peptide sample cleanup, solid-phase extraction, and nucleic acid extraction, all within in an enclosed system that includes waste collection.

The system pairs a on-deck modular manifold stack with an off-deck vacuum pump control box, and a 2-liter carboy for waste collection. The included on-deck pieces—a set of short and tall collars and height spacers, along with ANSI/SLAS compliant filter plates—are compatible with the Flex Gripper.

The module is represented in code by a [`VacuumModuleContext`][opentrons.protocol_api.VacuumModuleContext] object that includes methods for asynchronous vacuum pressure control (in mbar), pump duty-cycle regulation (power control), deck plate staging, and system venting.

The Vacuum Module is compatible with the filter plates listed below and in the [Opentrons Labware Library](https://labware.opentrons.com/). The module also works with other ANSI/SLAS compliant filter plates, but you should test these before use. Organized by manufacturer, refer to these tables to find the API `load_name` for a supported filter plate.
