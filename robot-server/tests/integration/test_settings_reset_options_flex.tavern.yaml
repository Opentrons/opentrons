  # POSTing bootScripts, pipetteOffsetCalibrations, and runsHistory are untested here because they
  # should already be covered by the OT-2 test.

  # POSTing onDeviceDisplay is untested here because it writes to a part of the filesystem outside
  # of robot-server's control, which is not a good thing to do on a dev machine.
  # We rely on manual end-to-end tests (with the Opentrons App) to cover it.
