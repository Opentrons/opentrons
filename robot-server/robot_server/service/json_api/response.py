        The route method (i.e. the .post() method of the router) is the first argument and the rest of the
        arguments are keyword args that are forwarded to the route handler.

        For instance:
        @PydanticResponse.wrap_route(

        The reason this exists is that if you do not specify a response_model, pydantic will parse the return
        value annotation and try to stuff it in a pydantic field. Pydantic fields can't handle arbitrary classes,
        like fastapi.JSONResponse; therefore, you get an exception while parsing the file (since this all happens
        in a decorator). The fix for this is to always specify a response_model, even if you're also doing a return
        value annotation and/or responses={} arguments.

        This decorator does that for you! Just take any route handler that returns a PydanticResponse (you still have to
        annotate it as such, and return PydanticResponse.create(...) yourself, this only handles the decorating part) and
        replace its route decoration with this one, passing the erstwhile route decorator in.
