    !!! important "Important note about non-deterministic protocols"
        Python protocols are allowed to be written in a way that makes their
        behavior non-deterministic. For example, a protocol could use ``random``
        to determine how much volume to aspirate.

        If a protocol is non-deterministic, an analysis may differ from the
        actual run (or any subsequent analysis). If you are writing or using
        non-deterministic protocols, please keep this fact in mind.

        JSON protocols are currently deterministic by design.
