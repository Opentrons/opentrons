"""SQLite database migrations.

Adding new tables to the database is handled transparently
by SQLAlchemy. This simple migrations module exists to
allow us to modify existing tables when we need to.

- Add new, nullable columns
- Add new, non-nullable columns with default values
- Delete columns (possible, but ill-advised)
- Drop tables (possible, but ill-advised)

Since SQLAlchemy does not provide an interface for `ALTER TABLE`,
these migrations are defined using raw SQL commands, instead.
If we ever have more complicated migration needs, we should
bring in a tool like Alembic instead.

Database schema versions:

- Version 0
    - Initial schema version

- Version 1
    This migration adds the following nullable columns to the run table:

    - Column("state_summary, sqlalchemy.PickleType, nullable=True)
    - Column("commands", sqlalchemy.PickleType, nullable=True)
    - Column("engine_status", sqlalchemy.String, nullable=True)
    - Column("_updated_at", sqlalchemy.DateTime, nullable=True)

- Version 2:
    This migration adds the following nullable column to the analysis table:

    - Column("completed_analysis_as_document", sqlalchemy.String, nullable=True)

    It then populates the column with data converted from elsewhere in the table,
    so entries should never be NULL in practice even though nullable=True.
