    In its HTTP API, robot-server expresses error recovery policies as Pydantic models.
    But opentrons.protocol_engine is more general, expressing them as Python callables.

    Args:
        rules: The rules in the robot-server error recovery policy.
        enabled: Whether error recovery should be enabled at all.
            If `False`, `rules` is ignored.
