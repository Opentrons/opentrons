        Add a single command to the run. You can add commands to a run
        for three reasons:

        - Setup commands (`data.source == "setup"`)
        - Protocol commands (`data.source == "protocol"`)
        - Fixit commands (`data.source == "fixit"`)

        Setup commands may be enqueued before the run has been started.
        You could use setup commands to prepare a module or
        run labware calibration procedures.

        Protocol commands may be enqueued anytime using this endpoint.
        You can create a protocol purely over HTTP using protocol commands.
        If you are running a protocol from a file(s), then you will likely
        not need to enqueue protocol commands using this endpoint.

        Fixit commands may be enqueued while the run is `awaiting-recovery` state.
        These commands are intended to fix a failed command.
        They will be executed right after the failed command
        and only if the run is in a `awaiting-recovery` state.

        Once enqueued, setup commands will execute immediately with priority,
        while protocol commands will wait until a `play` action is issued.
        A play action may be issued while setup commands are still queued,
        in which case all setup commands will finish executing before
        the run moves on to protocol commands.

        If you are running a protocol file(s), use caution with this endpoint,
        as added commands may interfere with commands added by the protocol
